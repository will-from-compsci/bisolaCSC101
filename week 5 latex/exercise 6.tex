	Dimensional metrology and alignment methods are significant and vital during different manufacturing processes. Dimension inspection processes play a crucial role in controlling the position accuracy of production \cite{gu2020study}. P. Maresca et al identified the precise, safer and more flexible \cite{maresca2019evaluation}. The highly-automated measuring and control systems demanded by the industries could use several approaches to metrology process is used on industrial systems, components and objects to perform inspections, alignment and measurement \cite{moru2020machine}. It offers economic arguement measurement information infrastructure's potential impacts on cost-effectiveness and risks for IoT measuring instruments adoption \cite{kuster2020measurement}. Metrological systems are based upon the principle of a good alignment system. The inspection and alignment of larger scale components with a strict precision were concerned in the high-tech and heavy industry \cite{gu2020study}. Good alignment inspection is one of the most important methods to ensure safe measurement \cite{peng2020inertial}.
